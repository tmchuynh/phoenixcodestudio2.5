#### Workflow collaboration

Postman enables teams to work together on API development by sharing collections, environments, and documentation. This promotes efficient teamwork and minimizes communication gaps. Postman used to be a platform where people worked in isolation and tested APIs on their own. With commenting, forking, branching, pull requests, tagging, and more, working together has never been easier. Take advantage of the multiplayer experience with shared workspaces—and make it a group effort. This is particularly useful for teams working on large projects, as it helps maintain consistency and clarity in API design. The ability to generate documentation automatically from collections and share it with team members or external stakeholders streamlines the process of keeping everyone informed about API changes and updates.

#### Built-in Libraries

Postman has a suite of external libraries available to use in the Pre-request and Test script tabs. These libraries make developers’ lives much easier by providing functionality not necessarily built into JavaScript. Some of the ones I’ve used the most are Moment.js (a JavaScript date library for formatting and working with dates), Lodash (a javascript library providing utility functions), and Faker.js (a dummy data generator).

#### Collection-Level Information

For variables, scripts, and auth credentials that will be reused for multiple requests in a specific folder or collection, Postman makes it easy to follow the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) software development principle. Most users know you can set collection-level variables as well as authentication at the collection level, which get inherited. But a lesser-known feature is the ability to write code in the Pre-request and Tests tabs that will run before and after each request in the collection, respectively. This is a great way to set up a collection-level test that will run after every request in the collection. This is particularly useful for testing APIs that require authentication or have specific requirements for each request.

#### Monitors for Regression Testing

Monitors are a great way to stay up to date on the health and performance of your APIs. They run through your collections and give you the status of your tests, but they’re really only as good as your tests. By running the same monitor automatically in different environments, you can test against a multitude of scenarios throughout the day. This helps you flag issues early and achieve continuous and automated regression testing. The combination of monitors and environments also allows you to run monitors against different development environments by having an environment for staging and production for example.

#### Built-in GraphQL Support

GraphQL has exploded in popularity in recent years, and Postman is here to support that. Whether it’s supporting GraphQL variables or sending GraphQL queries in the request body as POST requests, Postman has you covered. My personal favorite is the query autocompletion with user-defined GraphQL schemas. This is a great way to test your GraphQL queries and make sure you’re sending the right data. Postman also provides built-in support for GraphQL variables, making it easy to pass dynamic data into your queries. This is particularly useful for testing APIs that require complex queries or mutations, as it allows you to easily modify the input data without having to rewrite the entire query. This feature is especially helpful for developers who are new to GraphQL, as it provides a more intuitive way to interact with the API and understand how the data is structured.

### Additional Information

#### The Postman API

The Postman API allows you to programmatically access data stored in your Postman account. Perform all the classic CRUD operations on your collections, environments, mocks, and more. I think the coolest thing here is the webhooks folder. 

#### Postman Echo

Postman Echo is a service that we built as a bit of a sanity checker and learning tool. It allows you to test your REST clients and make sample API calls. As the name suggests, the API “echos” back what you sent to it, which is a great way to see what you’re sending to a server without having to analyze backend logs. You can send requests through various protocols (GET, POST, PUT), explore different authentication methods, and play around with different parameters.

#### Postman Visualizer

Postman provides a programmable way to visually represent your request responses. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we can add visualization for the response body right into Postman. Use the Visualizer to present your response data in ways that help you make sense of it. You can also import any of your favorite charting libraries such as D3.js, Chart.js, etc. to make the visualization highly customizable. This is particularly useful for APIs that return complex data structures, as it allows you to create custom visualizations that make it easier to understand the data. The Visualizer also supports dynamic data binding, allowing you to create interactive visualizations that respond to user input.
